Yes 👍 — if you don’t want to deal with **git commands**, there are simpler Obsidian community plugins that hide the complexity and just “sync to GitHub” for you.

Here are the best **less complex** ones:

---

## 🔹 1. **GitHub Publisher**

* Made for **non-technical users**.
* You just connect it once with a **GitHub token** → then click “Publish” and it pushes your notes.
* Supports publishing only certain folders/notes if you want.
* Good if your main goal is “backup” (or even making a public wiki).

---

## 🔹 2. **Obsidian Git** (by Vinzent)

* More popular than “GitHub Sync.”
* Still uses Git, but automates it inside Obsidian.
* Features:

  * Auto-commit on save/exit/startup.
  * Auto-push/pull on schedule.
  * Button in ribbon to sync.
* You almost never need to open a terminal after setup.

---

## 🔹 3. **Remotely Save**

* Backs up to **cloud storage** (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, WebDAV, S3, etc.).
* Not GitHub-specific, but much simpler if you just want a cloud backup.

---

### ✅ My recommendation if you don’t know Git:

* **GitHub Publisher** → easiest if you just want to click and push notes to GitHub.
* **Remotely Save** → if you’re okay with Google Drive/OneDrive instead of GitHub.
